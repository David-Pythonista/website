                            <p> Of all forms of imaging, photography is the most closely 
                                related to reality. In the case of photographs, the 
                                authenticity comes from the technique itself, because the 
                                photograph is created by the rays reflected from the object. 
                                It has an important role in preserving and shaping individual
                                and community memory. The photograph highlights, accentuates
                                and attracts attention. The events of our individual lives
                                and the history of society live more vividly in us and can
                                be recalled more easily if a photograph has been taken of them.
                                The photograph is suitable for recording reality, showing 
                                its manipulative distorted form, and can be art.

                                I take pictures on different subjects, such as nature 
                                photos, landscapes, object photos, mood pictures or
                                portraits.</p>

                            <p> Via ferrata is a special kind of climbing. In this case,
                                there is a trail system that leads along the path.
                                It helps to handle difficult parts of the climbing and give
                                a safe oppurtinity to do this sport.
                                I climbed in the surrounding countries, like Austria and Slovenia,
                                routes for via ferrata, as well as in Hungary. </p>

                            <p> I started to learn Bachata a couple of years ago. After accomplishing a few
                                dancing courses, I still stayed in the dancing school to practice more. Beside
                                Bachata I learned Salsa too, in different variations.</p>

                            <p> In my free time, sometimes I play my acoustic guitar. It's not just require
                                high attention and concentrating to play fluently, and this way improve those
                                skills, but also a relaxing activity to do.</p>
